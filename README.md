# MyGwazoo
This is just demonstration of work I did in gwazoo.com. User can submit excel file, then it validates all inputs. 
If there are any problem, it display either warning or error message. 
Otherwise, it upload to temporary database to provide preview. 
Once user inspect and click upload button, it uploads products to real database.

This is for demonstration only, it does not work without other main files.
